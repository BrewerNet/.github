## Welcome to the coffee bean 👋


**:star: About the Community :star:**

The Coffee Bean is a social networking community on Discord created to provide students with a space to discuss homework, share campus life, and connect with teammates for academic projects, side projects, or startup ventures. This server is completely free and open to students from all educational institutions.

we founded the server recognising the challenge of locating dependable team members and collaborating with individuals from diverse fields to form a well-rounded team. As the platform is in its early stages, we are open to suggestions for improvements. Feel free to direct message us with your ideas, and we invite you to join us.
